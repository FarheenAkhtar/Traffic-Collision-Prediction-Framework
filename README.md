# Traffic-Collision-Prediction-Framework
In this project, the following problem statement is explored:
Are we able to set up a model that could predict the next type of traffic collision in the City of Calgary?

Literature Review 

#Step1: Data Preprocessing:
Create dataframe |
Check for datatype & correct class labels |
Check and enter NA for Missing Values |
Split Datetime labels into Hours, Days, Months for better data processing

#Step2: Exploratory Data Analysis:
Boxplots & outliers |
Histograms |
Correlations |
Clustering (DBSCAN) algorithm

#Step3: Feature Engineering:
Class attribute transformation


#Step4: Model Training:
Keras

#Step5: Results & Visualization
